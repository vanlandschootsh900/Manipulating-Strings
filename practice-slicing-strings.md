## Practice: Slicing Strings

### Submitting Your Work

> Copy, paste and submit the URL (web address) of your project repo on Google Classroom

### Getting Started

- Add a NEW Python file called `slicing_strings.py` to your GitHub repo named `slicing-practice` 
- Add a comment block to the top of your `slicing_strings.py` file, like so:
```python
# Your first and last name
# Today's date
# Slicing Strings 
```

### Resources

- Watch this video about [string slicing](https://youtu.be/7pXf1DUuaIo?feature=shared) in Python
    - NOTE: String slicing is also known as *string indexing*

### Your Practice Project

*You will need to watch the video above about string indexing in order to complete your practice project.*

#### Part 1: Accessing Characters Using a POSITIVE index number

- Assign this string to a variable named `nevada`: "I've met the aliens at Area 51!"
- Then use string indexing to:
    - access and print the character in the Area 51 string at index 2
    - access and print the character in the Area 51 string at index 10
    - access and print the character in the Area 51 string at index 16
    - access and print the characters in the Area 51 string from index 5 to index 8 (but not including the character at index 8)

#### Part 2: Accessing Characters Using a NEGATIVE index number

- Assign this string to a variable named `star_wars`: "May the Force be with you!"
- Then use string indexing to:
    - access and print the character in the Star Wars string at index -12
    - access and print the character in the Star Wars string at index -1
    - access and print the character in the Star Wars string at index -24
    - access and print the characters in the Star Wars string from index -19 to index -10
